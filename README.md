# Project Name: Fake News Detection 

## General Information

### Project Information

- This assignment aims to provide understanding of the application of semantic classification in real-world scenarios. 
- In this assignment, apart from implementing the semantic classification techniques, a basic understanding of how to train models to categorise text based on its meaning rather than just syntax.
- This technique is used in situations where understanding textual meaning plays a critical role in making accurate and efficient decisions.
- In this assignment, a semantic classification model that uses the Word2Vec method to detect recurring patterns and themes in news articles is used.
- With the use of supervised learning models, the goal is to build a system that classifies news articles as either fake or true.

### Project Background

- The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge in todayâ€™s digital world.
- With the constant flow of news articles published daily, it is becoming harder to distinguish between credible and misleading information. - This creates a need for systems that can automatically classify articles as true or fake, helping reduce misinformation and protect public trust.

### Data Set
In this assignment, there are two data sets: 
- The true news data set includes 21,417 true news, whereas the fake news data set comprises 23,502 fake news articles. 
- Each data set includes the following three key attributes:
-- Title: The headline of the news article
-- Text: The main body content of the article
-- Date: The publication date of the article
